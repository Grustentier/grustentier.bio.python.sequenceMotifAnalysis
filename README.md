# Structure Topology Prediction of Discriminative Sequence Motifs in Membrane Proteins with Domains of Unknown Functions
## Motivation
Membrane proteins play essential roles in cellular processes of organisms. Photosynthesis, transport of ions and small 
molecules, signal transduction, and light harvesting are examples of processes which are realised by membrane proteins and

contribute to a cell‚Äôs specificity and functionality. The analysis of membrane proteins has shown to be an important part in the
understanding of complex biological processes. Genome-wide investigations of membrane proteins have revealed a large number
of short, distinct sequence motifs. Results. The in silico analysis of 32 membrane protein families with domains of unknown
functions discussed in this study led to a novel approach which describes the separation of motifs by residue-specific distributions.

Based on these distributions, the topology structure of the majority of motifs in hypothesised membrane proteins with unknown
topology can be predicted. Conclusion. We hypothesise that short sequence motifs can be separated into structure-forming motifs
on the one hand, as such motifs show high prediction accuracy in all investigated protein families. This points to their general

importance in ùõº-helical membrane protein structure formation and interaction mediation. On the other hand, motifs which show
high prediction accuracies only in certain families can be classified as functionally important and relevant for family-specific
functional characteristics.
